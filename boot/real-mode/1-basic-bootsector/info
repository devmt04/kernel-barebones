Boot Sector:
```````````
 * A boot sector, also known as a "boot record" or "master boot record (MBR)," is a small, fixed-size data structure located at the very beginning of a storage device, such as a hard drive or a removable disk like a USB drive.

* The (legacy) BIOS checks bootable devices for a boot signature, a so called magic number. The boot signature is in a boot sector (sector number 0) and it contains the byte sequence 0x55, 0xAA at byte offsets 510 and 511 respectively. 

* Whenever a bootable device is initialized, bios searches and loads the 1st sector which is known as boot sector or boot block into the RAM and starts executing it.

	Each sector is of 512 bytes.

* Bootsector coded in 16-bit or Real mode, for backward compatibility

*  boot sector is 512 bytes long and in 510th byte a symbol 0x55 is expected and in the 511th byte another symbol 0xaa is expected.

* In a typical x86-based PC, when you run a bootloader or a boot sector program, the program is loaded into memory at a specific address. The default address at which your bootloader or boot sector program is loaded is 0x7C00 (also written as 0x0000:0x7C00).
