# Kernel-barebones

Welcome to the "kernel-barebones" repository, your gateway to learning the fundamentals of kernel development and low-level programming. If you're on a journey to explore the intricate world of systems programming and want to engage with like-minded learners, you're in the right place.

# Learning Together

I'm currently on my own path of learning kernel development and diving into the depths of low-level programming. The journey can be both challenging and incredibly rewarding. And what's even more exciting is the opportunity to learn together. Join me in this quest to understand how operating systems work, how to interact with hardware at the lowest level, and how to create code that's close to the heart of the machine.
